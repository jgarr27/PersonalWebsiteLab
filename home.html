    <h1>My Blogging experience is limited in that I do not blog. I do not blog now nor have I ever blogged. The number of times I have thought about blogging up until this point is zero. I would rate my interest in blogging as null. However, if forced to choose between blogging and being eaten by a bear. I would choose blogging.  </h1>

   <h1>I am slowly but surely developing into a developer. I have excellent Dojo masters named Justin and Josh. Their skills are strong and one day I shall walk amongst them. Until said time, I am a NOOB. I do NOOB things and I make NOOB mistakes. One day though, in a time not too far from now, I will develop into a developer......that develops. </h1>

   <h1>My hometown is Chelsea, Michigan. It has a little more than 4000 people in it. It is the home of Jiffy Mix which makes terrific muffin mix. We have an ice rink, restaurants, a police station and fire department. </h1>
